CloudWatch Monitoring Scenario - Real Troubleshooting Notes

Goal:
Practice monitoring AWS resources, see what breaks, and learn how to fix it. This is real hands-on work for my portfolio.

1. Check EC2 Metrics
- Go to CloudWatch Metrics > EC2
- Look for CPUUtilization and StatusCheckFailed
- If nothing shows up:
  - Maybe the instance isn’t running
  - Wrong region selected
  - Or IAM permissions aren’t correct
- Notes: [Add what you found]

2. Validate CPU Alarm
- Go to Alarms > All Alarms
- Confirm CPU > 70% alarm exists
- If it doesn’t trigger:
  - Check instance ID in Dimensions
  - Check threshold and evaluation period
  - Generate CPU load manually (stress test)
- Notes: [Add what triggered, or didn’t]

3. Notifications (if configured)
- Check SNS or email notifications
- If nothing comes:
  - Alarm might not have AlarmActions set
  - Subscription to SNS topic could be missing
  - Emails may be in spam
- Notes: [Add what you observed]

4. Dashboard Check
- Open CloudWatch Dashboard
- Make sure CPU, Status Checks, Network metrics are visible
- If metrics missing:
  - Wrong instance or region
  - Metrics haven’t published yet
- Notes: [Add your dashboard observations]

5. Lessons Learned
- Metrics take a minute or two to show — don’t panic
- Load testing helps alarms trigger
- Document everything honestly — both successes and failures
- Notes: [Write what you struggled with, what you fixed, and what you learned]
